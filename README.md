#How to Use
To use this code for building a movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn) installed in your Python environment.

Download the 'movies.csv' and 'ratings.csv' files, and place them in the same directory as the script.

Run the script to load, preprocess, and analyze the data.

Modify the code as needed to suit your specific requirements or dataset.

Experiment with different movie titles to find similar movies based on user ratings.
